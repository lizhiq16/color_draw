# This project is a script written with python 3 with Numpy and Matplotlib installed.

## Rainbow_spectrum.py
Draw a spectrum full of rainbow colors, and the abscissa of the spectrum is the wavelength data in nanometers. There is a corresponding color fill only in the visible region (380-780nm), but the spectral wavelength range is not limited to the visible region. The interval of wavelength data is arbitrary; But keep in mind that the smaller the interval, the better the drawing.

## color_scatter.py
Draw a scatter plot of color dot, which are filled with a red-green-blue gradient color based on the abscissa values of the data. The function is to plot the output file obtained by analyzing weak interactions using Multiwfn （http://sobereva.com/399）.
