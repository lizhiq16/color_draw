# This project is a script written with python 3 with Numpy and Matplotlib installed.

## Rainbow_spectrum.py
Draw a spectral map filled with rainbow colors, the abscissa of the spectrum is the wavelength data (in nm). There is a corresponding color fill only in the visible region (380-780 nm), but the spectral value is not limited to the visible region. The interval of your data is arbitrary; but keep in mind that the smaller the interval, the better the plotting effect.

## color_scatter.py
Draw a scatter plot of color dot, which are filled with a red-green-blue gradient color based on the abscissa values of the data. The function is to plot the output file obtained by analyzing weak interactions using Multiwfn （http://sobereva.com/399）.
