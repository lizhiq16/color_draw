# This project is a script written with python 3 with Numpy and Matplotlib installed.

## Rainbow_spectrum.py
Draw a spectral map filled with rainbow colors, the abscissa of the spectrum is the wavelength data (in nm), and the interval is arbitrary (the smaller the interval, the better the plotting effect). There is a corresponding color fill only in the visible region (380-780 nm), but the spectral value is not limited to the visible region.

## color_scatter.py
Draw a scatter plot of dot colors, which are filled with a red-green-blue gradient based on the abscissa values of the spectrum. The function is to plot the output file obtained by analyzing weak interactions using Multiwfn （http://sobereva.com/399）.
